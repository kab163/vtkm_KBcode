%(entitle a main section called 'Study Overview' or 'Experiments')
To study the Particle Advection code, we use a variety of scientific data sets for our experiments.
% (entitle a subsection called fusion)
First, we have a data set from the NIMROD simulation code (find cite). 
%
This simulation shows the magnetically confined fusion in a tokamak device.
%
With the nature of the simulation, the data set has a unique property that the integral curves traverse the vector field domain repeatedly, giving a swirl-like appearance.
