This research was implented within the Ascent framework \cite{Larsen} and the experiments were run on NERSC's Cori supercomputer as well as NCAR's Cheyenne supercomputer.
%
Ascent provides a lightweight in situ infrastructure that includes a vtk-m wavelet implementation \cite{vtkm}. 
%

To determine the merit of our reallocation strategies compared to the standard, fixed wavelet compression, our strategies were run in situ on two different simulations present within Ascent and with varying I/O budgets.

\subsection{Experiment Parameters}
Below are the factors that we varied for each of our experiments. 
%
In total this research conducted 18 runs of our allocation strategies. 

\subsubsection{Simulations}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item Lulesh \cite{lulesh} is a hydrodynamics simulation that models the Sedov blast problem. 
%
This simulation had size $1000^3$ and ran for 10,200 cycles with 512 ranks on 32 nodes. 
%
The experiments for Lulesh were performed on Cori.
\item CloverLeaf3D \cite{clover} is a simulation that solves the compressible Euler equations. 
%
This simulation had size $1000^3$ and ran for 500 cycles with 64 ranks on 32 nodes. 
%
The experiments for CloverLeaf3D were performed on Cheyenne.

\subsection{Measurements}
The Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) is calculated for the compressed output compared to the original data. 
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item Maximum and Average NRMSE
\end{itemize}
