Wavelet compression is a class of transform-based techniques with their core operation
being wavelet transforms.
%
Such a transform decomposes data into coefficients in the wavelet domain, 
representing information in various time and frequency scales.
%
%With careful choice of wavelet kernels and transformation methods, 
%the same number of wavelet coefficients are generated to preserve all the 
%information content of the input data.
%
In the use case of compression, wavelet kernels and transformation methods 
are chosen such that the transform is 
1) \textit{nonexpansive}, meaning that the number of output coefficients equals the 
number of input data points, and 
2) \textit{invertible}, meaning that input data could be reconstructed in its full fidelity.


Compression using wavelets happens when a portion, but not all, of wavelet coefficients are 
used to reconstruct the original data.
%
Errors are introduced with the discarding of coefficients.
%
However, a selection of wavelet transforms have an outstanding capability of \textit{information 
concentration}, meaning that the vast majority of information in the data is disproportionately 
kept in a small amount of coefficients, namely the ones with the largest magnitudes.
%
The Haar and CDF wavelet kernels~\cite{cohen1992biorthogonal}
exhibit all the properties mentioned above, thus are most often used for compression.


%With this study, we look into the information content of wavelet coefficients from 
%different simulation domains, which are produced by separate wavelet transforms.
%
%Magnitude difference across domains no longer warrant difference in information content.
%
%Our research then looks into possible means that correlate with importance of domains, 
%and use those means to direct us to reallocate I/O budget.
