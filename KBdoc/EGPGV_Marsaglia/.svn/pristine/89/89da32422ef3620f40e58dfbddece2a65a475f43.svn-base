This work introduces an approach for automatically adapting
I/O resources based on data complexity.
%
The results show benefit for a simulation where data complexity is imbalanced
and also for a simulation in early phases of simulation.
%
Further, among our two strategies, Shannon entropy better captured information
content than an inherently wavelet based approach.
%
In terms of future work, we would like to integrate this into in situ frameworks, and also evaluate on more simulation codes.
