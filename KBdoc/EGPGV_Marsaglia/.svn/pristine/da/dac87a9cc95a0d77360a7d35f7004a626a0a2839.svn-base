The chosen simulations take time to advance to an interesting state, so for the majority of the timesteps only rank 0 had pertinent data.

Thus, the reallocation strategies were able to devote their entire I/O budget to saving rank 0's data, whereas the standard compression would only save a fixed portion of rank 0's data.
