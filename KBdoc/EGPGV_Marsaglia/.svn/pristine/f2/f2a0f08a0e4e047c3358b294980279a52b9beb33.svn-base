Visualization under the old paradigm required data producers to save out every timestep, at which point the data would be visualized post-hoc. 
%
But the increasing gap between compute and I/O capabilities has made the old post-hoc paradigm unpalatable. 
%
This has lead to new approaches, namely in situ visualization and analysis. 
%
The former produces images as the simulation runs, but no data is saved. 
%
The latter performs lightweight analysis that should reduce the amount of data being saved, allowing for post-hoc analysis. 
%
This paper focuses on the later technique. 
%
And more specifically, this research focuses on in situ wavelet compression. 

For large-scale simulations, saving every timestep is a non-starter. 
%
Instead, simulations will save individual timesteps at fixed or variable intervals. 
%
And even then, those chosen time steps will utilize some form of compression to further minimize the I/O burden. 
%
One such compression technique is wavelet compression. 
%
Given a compression ratio, or I/O budget, wavelet compression uses a filter to prioritize the most important data. 

Typically, during a large-scale, parallel simulation, each domain is allocated the same amount of resources, especially when it comes to the desired I/O budget.%
But some domains may contain data of little consquence, and thus, their resources may be better utilized elsewhere. 
%
This research uses two strategies to reallocate the I/O budget of each domain for each timestep as the simulation runs. 

The first reallocation strategy is specific to wavelet compression. 
%
Wavelet compression inherently prioritizes data within a domain, we use this information to calculate a domain's data's global importance, and reallocate the I/O allocation accordingly. 
%
The second reallocation strategy encorporates Shannon Entropy, a calculation that has become common in information science and determining the importance of data. 
%
The Shannon Entropy is calculated for each domain, and then compared globally, a domain's I/O budget is then determined by the global entropy calculation.

This research showed that ...
