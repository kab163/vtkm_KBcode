With this paper we have shown that in situ analysis can be a valuable tool for distributing resources of large scale simulations. 
%
Specifically, we've presented two strategies that dynamically allocate the I/O budget among the ranks of a parallel simulation, performing analysis to determine the ranks with the most pertinent data.

This way, important data can be saved at the highest resolution possible.

And in some cases, even lead to increased I/O savings.
