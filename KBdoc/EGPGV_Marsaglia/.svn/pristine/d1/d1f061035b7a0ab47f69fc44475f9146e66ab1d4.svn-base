This research was implented within the Ascent framework CITE and the experiments were run on NERSC's Cori machine CITE.
%
Ascent provides a lightweight in situ infrastructure that includes a vtk-m CITE wavelet implementation. 
%

To determine the merit of our reallocation strategies compared to the standard, fixed wavelet compression, algorithm was run in situ on two different simulations present within Ascent and with varying I/O budgets.
%
Each simulation was run for 50000 timesteps. 
%  
\subsection{Experiment Parameters}
Below are the factors that we varied for each of our experiments. 
%
In total this research conducted 18 runs of our allocation strategies.
